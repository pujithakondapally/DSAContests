      "\n",
      "These rules are called **HTTP methods**, which are like different ways you can ask for food:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **GET** is like saying \"I'll have a burger, please!\" - you're asking for something specific.\n",
      "* **POST** is like saying \"I'd like to order a new meal, but I don't know what it is yet\" - you're sending some data and letting the Server decide how to use it.\n",
      "* **PUT** is like saying \"Can I change my burger to a chicken sandwich?\" - you're asking for something specific, but you want to change it slightly.\n",
      "* And so on.\n",
